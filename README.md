# üöÄ FireDucks vs Pandas: A Benchmarking Comparison for Large-Scale Data Processing

This repository presents a practical comparison between **FireDucks** and **Pandas** for efficient large-scale data processing. It includes performance benchmarks, code implementations, and insights into the strengths and limitations of both libraries.

## üìò Overview

As datasets continue to grow in size and complexity, traditional tools like Pandas face limitations in speed and memory efficiency. FireDucks is a modern alternative built to scale better with large data volumes, offering faster operations while maintaining a familiar syntax.

This repo includes:

- üî• A quick introduction to FireDucks and how it differs from Pandas  
- üìä Code-based performance benchmarks for common operations like sorting, grouping, and transformations  
- üß™ Best practices for using FireDucks, and when to convert back to Pandas  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Techniques to enable benchmark mode and monitor execution time

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- FireDucks  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## ‚ö° Benchmarking Results

| Operation               | FireDucks Time (s) | Pandas Time (s) |
|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Load CSV               | 0.78               | 2.12            |
| Sorting                | 0.54               | 1.67            |
| Grouping (Aggregation) | 0.43               | 1.91            |
| String Transformation  | 0.26               | 1.04            |

> FireDucks shows noticeable performance gains for data-heavy tasks, making it a strong choice for handling large datasets.

## üîç Core Operations Demonstrated

- **Loading CSV Files** using `fpd.read_csv()`  
- **Dataset Expansion** via `pd.concat()`  
- **Column Dropping** with `.drop(columns=[])`  
- **Sorting** by columns with `.sort_values()`  
- **Grouping and Aggregation** using `.groupby().sum()`  
- **Fake Data Generation** using `np.random.randint()`  
- **String Transformations** using `.astype(str) + "_FD"`  
- **Pandas Conversion** for unsupported operations via `.to_pandas()`

Each operation is timed to demonstrate performance, giving a clear understanding of FireDucks' efficiency in real scenarios.

## ‚ùì FAQs

**Q: Can FireDucks fully replace Pandas?**  
A: Not yet. While FireDucks is faster for many operations, it doesn't support all functionalities of Pandas. You can convert to Pandas when needed.

**Q: Is FireDucks easy to learn for Pandas users?**  
A: Yes! The API design is quite similar, making it beginner-friendly for those already familiar with Pandas.

**Q: What kind of datasets benefit most from FireDucks?**  
A: Large and wide datasets with repetitive processing needs like filtering, grouping, and sorting.
